== Introduction

TODO

== Script (timing ~10 minutes)
- start workspace
- workspace is failing to start
- what should we do? is user remains "one on one" with the issue? how devs become aware of the issue? how can devs investigate the issue in the Cloud-Native / microservice world?
- intro to the OpenTracing project and distributed tracing 
- showing Jaeger integration by finding the root cause of the issue
- what about the monitoring / health of the system? 
    - number of failed workspaces?
    - average workspace startup
    - JVM specific metrics
- showing Prometheus / Grafana
